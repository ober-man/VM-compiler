# Intermediate Representation (IR)

Graph-based IR for further optimizations and analyses passes on it. 

## Graph 
A standard [graph](https://github.com/ober-man/VM-compiler/blob/main/ir/graph.h) representation, where nodes are Basic Blocks. Represents both Contol FLow Graph (CFG) and Data Flow Graph (DFG). Contains a vector of BBs with unique id.
Some graph helpers:
- [MarkerManager](https://github.com/ober-man/VM-compiler/blob/main/ir/marker.h) - a helper class to mark visited graph nodes while some kind of processing. The main its aim is to prevent process looping. Support some simultaneously graph processing. 
- [PassManager](https://github.com/ober-man/VM-compiler/blob/main/pass/passmanager.h) - a helper class to run passes and optimizations.

## Basic Block
[Basic Block](https://github.com/ober-man/VM-compiler/blob/main/ir/basicblock.h) (BB) is a linear sequence of instructions with no enter except the first instruction and no exit except the last instruction.
Each BB can have 1 or 2 successors and any number of predecessors. Edges represents CFG edges.
BB contains instructions. Instructions are designed as a double-linked intrusive list with knowing next and prev instructions.

## Instruction
[Instruction](https://github.com/ober-man/VM-compiler/blob/main/ir/inst.h) has dataflow users and operands.
Instructions structure:
- BinaryInst: arithmetic Add/Sub/Mul/Div, bitwise Shl/Shr, logic And/Or/Xor, compare Cmp
- UnaryInst: Neg, Not, Return
- ConstInst: i32/i64/f32/f64 constant. Constants are located at the first BB for convenience
- ParamInst: i32/i64/f32/f64 function parameter. Params are also located at the first BB
- JumpInst: conditional Je/Jne/Ja/Jb or unconditional Jmp instruction
- CallInst: Call function with dynamic operands list
- PhiInst: Phi function to choose correct operand depend on previous control-flow branch

## Example
```
                 [1]
                  |
                  v
             /---[2]---\
             |         |
             v         v
            [3]------>[4]
 ```
 ```

auto* v4 = new BinaryInst{4, InstType::Add, v1, v0};
auto* v5 = new JumpInst{5, InstType::Jmp, bb4};
bb3->pushBackInst(v4);
